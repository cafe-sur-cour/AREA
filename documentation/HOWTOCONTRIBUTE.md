# How to Contribute to AREA

This file should serve as a practical guide for extending the project's functionality. It must detail the process for adding new elements such as services, actions, reactions, or other core features. Your documentation should enable others to easily set up the development environment, understand how to use and extend the application, and contribute effectively to the project.

## Adding Services, Actions, and Reactions

For detailed information about the services architecture and how to implement new services with actions and reactions, see the [Services Architecture Documentation](./services/SERVICES_ARCHITECTURE.md).
