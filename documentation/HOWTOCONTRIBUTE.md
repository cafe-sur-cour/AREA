# How to Contribute to AREA

This file should serve as a practical guide for extending the project's functionality. It must detail the process for adding new elements such as services, actions, reactions, or other core features. Your documentation should enable others to easily set up the development environment, understand how to use and extend the application, and contribute effectively to the project.

## Commit Guidelines

This project follows the **Conventional Commit Message Guidelines**, which help maintain a clear and consistent Git history. The format is:

```
<type> (<scope>): <content>
```

### Common Types

- feat: A new feature
- fix: A bug fix
- docs: Documentation only changes
- style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc.)
- refactor: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
- test: Adding or correcting tests
- upt: Updating an element that is not a refactor
- rm: Remove a line of code or a file from the repo
- memo: Add a new documentation element
